It provides optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations accross Nordic regions with minimal techincal obstacles. The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, and promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve NorESM and its land component on the one hand, and promote the usage of NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers on the other hand. The observation sites currently included in the platform For more information on the platform, please see our technical documentation . Quick guides for using the platform Quick installation for developers Note that we are using NREC for development and testing for the time being. In the future, we want a more flexible solution using Docker. To use NREC, you need a user account and to apply for resources, so get in touch if you need this! Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform.git cd NorESM_LandSites_Platform Remember to switch to the correct branch of interest, e.g.: git branch -a # Lists all remote branches git checkout -b my_new_branch origin/platform_dev To install the NorESM and NREC dependencies: cd .machine/NREC_VM_setup chmod +x install_platform.sh ./install_platform.sh To install the Python package and its dependencies: cd ~/NorESM_LandSites_Platform pip install -e . # ATTENTION, note the \".\"! User: GALAXY tools, workflows and tutorials A graphic user interface for running site-level simulation is available on the cloud computing platform GALAXY as a tool (CTSM/FATES-EMERALD), with a dedicated tutorial and workflows for its usage.
