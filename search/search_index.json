An early version of the platform is also available on Galaxy . Platform content You can use the platform to run single-cell model simulations . We provide sites with high quality input data (atmospheric forcing, land surface data, 'spin-up'), and narrow down the long list of possible output variables into something manageable. add an illustration here Input data Running the model requires specifying compsets, atmospheric forcing, land surface parameters, and spin-up to get realistic simulations. The input data are here , with a readme file with further detail. The .tar files are compressed, and can be opened as a folder with e.g. 7-zip by right-clicking and choosing 'open archive', and used after extracting (unzipping). The data files are stored in .nc (NetCDF) format, which can be viewed using Panoply, or packages in Python or R . The output data from simulations are stored in the same format. The input data .tar file contains three folders: (1) 'shared' domain files with gridcell longitude, latitude, and area; (2) land (=lnd) surface data, and (3) atmosphere (=atm) data. The input data are site -specific. Compsets Short for component sets, compsets specify which component models are used as well as specific settings for forcing scenarios and physics options. Compsets have a short name and a longer name with abbreviations denoting the components included. See more in the CLM user guide . Currently, we only support the following 'compset', with long name: 2000_DATM%1PTGSWP3_CLM50%FATES_SICE_SOCN_MOSART_SGLC_SWAV The notation for the compset longname is: TIME_ATM[%phys]\\_LND[%phys]\\_ICE[%phys]\\_OCN[%phys]\\_ROF[%phys]\\_GLC[%phys]\\_WAV[%phys] The compset longname has a specified order: atm, lnd, ice, ocn, river, glc, and wave. Each component model version may be \"active,\" \"data,\" \"dead,\" or \"stub\". Stub components are used instead of active to save computation time and input requirements when that component is not needed for the model configuration. For instance, the active land component forced with atmospheric data, does not need ice, ocn, or glc components to be active and can replace them with stubs.

Atmospheric forcing Atmospheric forcing data drives the modelled climate using a time series of climatic variables. Downloadable data products exist, but is often on too coarse scales for realistic single-point simulations. Here is a list of atmospheric forcing variables used in CLM: - Incident solar radiation (FSDS), W/m2 - Temperature at the lowest atmospheric level (TBOT), degrees K (or can be C) - Precipitation (PRECTmms), mm/s - Wind speed at the lowest atmospheric level (WIND), m/s Forcing data for our sites are stored with the rest of the input data .

Make sure the format and units are the exact same, otherwise the model will not be able to use them. For more information on using custom input to CLM, see the CLM documentation Surface data Surface data contains information the model needs about the land surface, such as land use trajectories, soil properties, vegetation parameters, and albedo . Here are some exaples of what the input data .tar contains: 'firedata' population density 'paramdata' CLM5 parameters: many parameters, covering e.g. Plant Functional Types (PFTs), allocation of carbon, photosynthetic pathway FATES parameters: many parameters, covering e.g. Plant Functional Types (PFTs), allometry, carbon pools, nitrogen uptake, mortality, recruitment, fuel load for fire module 'snicardata' snow \"growth\" parameters snow \"optics\" 'surfdata_map' surface data: soil depth & other properties, albedo & thermal conductance of different surface types, and fraction of gridcell covered by vegetation, land, & other land cover types 'urbandata' urban classes, building interior temperature Note that when CLM is running without FATES, a simpler 'big-leaf'-version of vegetation is used instead. The CLM5 and FATES parameters thus overlap to some degree, with FATES replacing some and adding other parameters when activated. For the Vestland climate grid sites , surface data has been created from raw data sets, using this script . There are publicly available data products that could be downloaded and extracted for the nearest model gridcell, given points coordinates, that contain all the necessary surface data.

Starting the model from \"bare ground\", the climate is not in equilibrium, there is no or only unrealistic soil, and the model needs time to grow and kill vegetation to get appropriate soil properties and a stable climate.

It provides optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations with minimal techincal obstacles. The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, and promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve NorESM and its land component on the one hand, and promote the usage of NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers on the other hand. The observation sites currently included in the platform are described in the Land sites section. Quick guides for using the platform Quick installation for developers Instructions for installation are found in the repository . Note that we are using NREC for development and testing for the time being. In the future, we want a more flexible solution using Docker. To use NREC, you need a user account and to apply for resources, so get in touch if you need this!

In particular, writing scientific code is a form of intellectual contribution, and one should expect that all such intellectual contributions are respected and given credit in any resulting published scientific work. To support the community and avoid issues of scientific misconduct related to the above principle, please respect the following rules: Document the version of the platform and models used in any publication, preferably by using a release tag (existing or newly created) if possible, or a commit hash if not. Do not use code without checking the license or discussing with the author(s) your intentions for using the code and receiving their permission to do so. When using model features that have recently been integrated into this or the central NorESM/CLM/FATES development repositories, be mindful of the contributions of others and, where the novel features qualitatively affect the results of a given simulation, involve the author(s) of these features in any resulting manuscripts. Be particularly aware of the concerns of early career researchers, and ensure they have sufficient opportunities to lead publications using their developments. When discussing results arising from older model features that have been described in the literature, accurately cite the publications describing those features or releases.","title":"Scientific Use and Publication Ethics"},{"location":"contributing/#enforcement-responsibilities","text":"Community leaders should clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior and take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
